This course will introduce you to the fundamentals of probability theory
and random processes. The theory of probability was originally developed
in the 17th century by two great French mathematicians, Blaise Pascal
and Pierre de Fermat, to understand gambling. Today, the theory of
probability has found many applications in science and engineering.
Engineers use data from manufacturing processes to sample
characteristics of product quality in order to improve the products
being produced. Pharmaceutical companies perform experiments to
determine the effect of a drug on humans and use the results to make
decisions about treatment of illnesses, while economists observe the
state of the economy over periods of time and use the information to
forecast the economic future. In this course, you will learn the basic
terminology and concepts of probability theory, including random
experiments, sample spaces, discrete distribution, probability density
function, expected values, and conditional probability. You will also
learn about the fundamental properties of several special distributions,
including binomial, geometric, normal, exponential, and Poisson
distributions, as well as how to use them to model real-life situations
and solve applied problems.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   define probability,sample space, events, and probability functions;
-   use combinations to evaluate the probability of outcomes in
    coin-flipping experiments;
-   calculate the probability of union and intersection of events and
    conditional probability;
-   apply Bayes’ theorem to simple situations;
-   calculate the expected values of discrete and continuous random
    variables;
-   determine the distribution of the sums of random variables;
-   calculate cumulative distributions and marginal distributions;
-   use random processes to model and predict phenomena governed by
    binomial, multinomial, geometric, exponential, normal, and Poisson
    distributions; and
-   explain and use the law of large numbers and the central limit
    theorem.

### Course Information

**Welcome to MA252: **Introduction to Probability Theory. General
information on this course and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Massachusetts Institute of Technology OpenCourseWare: Professor
    Dmitry Panchenko’s [Math 18.05: Introduction to Probability and
    Statistics Lecture
    Notes](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2005/lecture-notes/) (HTML)
-   YouTube: UCLA: Professor Herbert Enderton’s [Math 3C: Math and
    Probability for Life Sciences Lecture
    Series](http://www.youtube.com/user/UCLACourses?feature=watch) (YouTube)
-   Khan Academy: Salman Khan’s [Probability Lecture
    Series](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability) (YouTube)
-   Dartmouth College: Professors Charles M. Grinstead and J. Laurie
    Snell’s [Introduction to
    Probability](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/amsbook.mac.pdf) (PDF)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials,
including the readings, lectures, and practice assignments. Pay special
attention to Unit 1 and Unit 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced material presented in the later units.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to complete the final exam
and earn 70% or higher. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon
as you finish it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for it, you will need to work
through all the readings, lectures, and practice assignments in the
course.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **115.25**
hours. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the amount of time
you are expected to spend on each subunit. These advisories should help
you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at the
time advisories, determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit, and then set goals for yourself. For
example, Unit 1 should take you approximately 18.75 hours. Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete Subunit 1.1 (a
total of 7 hours) on Monday and Tuesday nights, Subunit 1.2 (a total of
10.5 hours) on Wednesday and Thursday nights, etc.
