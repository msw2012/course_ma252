**Unit 3: Discrete Distributions** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about four basic discrete probability
distributions that have widespread applications in engineering and
science: binomial distributions, multinomial distributions, geometric
distributions, and Poisson distributions. One of the most common
applications of the binomial distribution is to test items for defects
as they come off an assembly line. For the geometric distribution, a
common application tests drugs that are known to be effective 70% of the
time. We might want to see the probability that the first person on whom
the drug is effective this week is the tenth one to take it or the
probability that the third person on whom it was effective is the sixth
to take it, etc. For the Poisson distribution, typical applications
include counting the number of phone calls received by an office in one
hour or the number of days school is closed due to snow in a winter.*

    Distributions”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSdPBlmQv_0)
    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch this video for an introduction to one of the
    most common discrete probability distributions: binomial
    distributions. You will learn how to decide if a distribution is
    binomial and how to find the mean, variance, and standard deviation
    of a binomial random variable.  
        
     If you perform a sequence of n independent, identical Bernoulli
    trials - that is, trials with only two possible outcomes: a success
    and a failure - then the random variable that counts the number of
    successes is called a binomial random variable. The probability of
    success is denoted by p, and the probability of failure, which is
    1 - p, is denoted by q.

     Instructions: Watch this video for an introduction to multinomial
    distributions. This is basically a generalization of the binomial
    distribution.

**3.3 Geometric Distributions** <span id="3.3"></span>

    Distributions”**

    Distributions”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrQZLyrUtkQ)
    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch this video for an introduction to multinomial
    distributions and geometric distributions. The geometric
    distribution has to do with Bernoulli trials, but it is different
    from the binomial distribution. This time you perform a sequence of
    independent, identical Bernoulli trials until you get the first
    success. The random variable that counts the number of trials needed
    is called a geometric random variable.  
        
     Watching this video and taking notes should take approximately 1
    hour and 30 minutes.

    Distributions” and “Lecture 15: Poisson Distributions (continued)”**

    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch these video lectures for an introduction to
    Poisson distributions. Poisson experiments are experiments that give
    the number of outcomes occurring during a given time interval or in
    a specific region. The random variables that count those outcomes
    are called Poisson random variables.  
        
     For example, a random variable X that counts the number of games
    postponed due to rain during a football season, or the number of
    phone calls received per hour by a secretary, are examples of
    Poisson random variables. Formulas for the distribution will be
    given as well as the expected value and variance. Specific examples
    will be given to illustrate the concepts.  
        
     Watching these videos and taking notes should take approximately 3
    hours.
