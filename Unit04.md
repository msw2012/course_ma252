**Unit 4: Continuous Distributions** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to several important continuous
probability distributions, including exponential distributions and
normal distributions. You will also learn about standard normal
distributions (i.e., a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a
standard deviation of 1). Normal distributions can be converted to
standard normal distributions by using a standard formula.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 17 hours.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1:  3 hours

    Math and Probability for Life Sciences*: “Lecture 16: Density
    Function” and “Lecture 17: Exponential Distributions”**

    Probability for Life Sciences*: [“Lecture 16: Density
    Function”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lB_bQ4Q244) (YouTube) and
    [“Lecture 17: Exponential
    Distributions”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5TG4a9cms8)
    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch these videos for an introduction to probability
    density functions of continuous random variables. The first video
    will explain the difference between discrete and continuous random
    variables and show how density functions are used to study
    continuous random variables. You will see several nice examples, and
    you will see again the definition of the expected value, or mean, of
    a continuous random variable.  
        
     The second video is a continuation of the first. It will show again
    how to get the variance and standard deviation of a continuous
    random variable. At minute 28, the exponential distribution, which
    is the subject of the next subunit, will be introduced as an
    example. It is worthwhile to watch it now. If you want to wait until
    the next subunit you can stop watching after minute 27.  
        
     Watching these videos and taking notes should take approximately 3
    hours.

    common properties of exponential distributions. If you did not watch
    the last part of Lecture 17 in the previous subunit, please do so
    now, starting at minute 28. This section of the video defines the
    exponential distribution and some of its properties, such as the
    expected value, variance, etc... The second video will show
    applications of the exponential distributions and present some very
    nice real-life examples.

    probability. You will learn about its properties, and you will see
    its expected value, variance, and standard deviation.

**4.4 Standard Normal Distributions** <span id="4.4"></span>

    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch this video lecture for an introduction to
    standard normal distributions and transformations between standard
    normal distributions and other normal distributions. The standard
    normal distribution is a normal distribution with mean 0 and
    standard deviation 1. If you take any normal random variable,
    subtract its mean from it, and divide the result by its standard
    deviation, you will get a standard normal random variable. So, we
    just need to know about standard normal random variables for which
    probability tables are developed to compute the probabilities that
    the variable is less than a given value.

    hour and 30 minutes.
