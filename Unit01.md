**Unit 1: Introduction to Probability** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to fundamental concepts of probability
theory. You will learn the definitions of probability, random variables,
outcome space, events, and probability function. These concepts of
probability will be explored through simple chance experiments with
discrete outcomes, such as tossing a coin or rolling a die. Random
variables represent outcomes of chance experiments. You will also learn
about four basic set operations - union, intersection, difference, and
complement. This unit will also introduce you to the concepts of
conditional probability (i.e., the probability of event A, given the
occurrence of some other event B) and* *Bayes’Theorem, which is one of
the most celebrated theorems in the theory of probability.*

     Instructions: Read both sets of lecture notes for an introduction
    to the basic concepts of probability. If one performs an experiment
    that has random outcomes, the set of all possible outcomes, S, is
    called the sample space, and the elements of S are called sample
    points. Subsets of S are called events and are usually denoted by
    letters like A, B, E, F, etc....  
        
     The probability of an event A, usually denoted by P(A), is defined
    by k/n, where n is the total number of possible outcomes of the
    experiment and k is the number of outcomes that result in the
    occurrence of A. Since events are sets, one needs to know about set
    operations. This lecture will give you more details about sets and
    how to compute probabilities of events.     
        
     Reading these lecture notes should take approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: Read this lecture for an introduction to one of the
    most important formulas in probability theory - Bayes’ Theorem. This
    reading will demonstrate the power of Bayes’ theorem through several
    real-world examples. You will first learn that 2 events A and B are
    independent if P(A and B) = P(A)P(B), which means that the
    occurrence of one of the two events, for instance A, does not affect
    the occurrence of the other event, B. Another interpretation using
    conditional probability will be given as well, and, finally, an
    important law used in Bayes’ formula, called the law of total
    probability, will be given.

    first stage of an experiment given that we know the outcome of the
