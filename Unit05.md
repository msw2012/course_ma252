**Unit 5: Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem** <span
id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about two important theorems of
Probability Theory: the law of large numbers and the central limit
theorem. The law of large numbers describes the result of performing the
same experiment a large number of times. The central limit theorem
states the conditions under which the mean of a large number of random
variables will be normally distributed.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 22 hours.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.1: 8.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.2: 8 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 5.3: 5.5 hours

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   use the law of large numbers to evaluate samples of random
    variables; and  
      
-   use the central limit theorem to estimate distributions of sample
    means.

    Laurie Snell’s *Introduction to Probability*: “Chapter 8, Section
    8.1: Law of Large Numbers for Discrete Random Variables” and

    Variables”**

    8.1: Law of Large Numbers for Discrete Random
    Variables”](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/amsbook.mac.pdf) (PDF)
    and [“Chapter 8, Section 8.2: Law of Large Numbers for Continuous
    Random
    Variables”](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/amsbook.mac.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 of “Chapter 8: Law
    of Large Numbers” on pages 305 - 320. This reading discusses the law
    of large numbers. If you have n independent, identically distributed
    random variables X1, X2, ..., Xn, let S be their sum. The law of
    large numbers says roughly that if n is very large, then S/n is a
    good approximation of the mean E(Xn). It is given as a limit
    theorem. Some nice applications will be given.  
        
     Reading these textbook sections and taking notes should take
    approximately 4 hours.

    Theorem”**

    Theorem”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i732VAgRiFQ) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch this video for an introduction to the Central
    Limit Theorem. The central limit theorem roughly says that if you
    select samples of size n randomly from a population of X values,
    where X is a random variable that has any distribution, then as n
    gets very large, the sample means will approach a normal
    distribution. Formulas for the mean and standard deviation of that
    normal distribution will be given. This is one of the most important
    concepts in statistics.  
        
     Watching this video and taking notes should take approximately 1
    hour and 30 minutes.
